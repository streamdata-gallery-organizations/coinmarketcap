  /v1/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical:
    get:
      summary: Get OHLCV values (historical)
      description: |-
        Return an interval of historic OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) market quotes for a cryptocurrency.

        **Technical Details**
        One OHLCV quote will be returned for every "time_period" between your "time_start" and "time_end".
        If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "time_period" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
        If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
        If you don't need every "time_period" between your dates you may adjust the frequency that "time_period" is sampled using the "interval" parameter. For example with "time_period" set to "daily" you may set "interval" to "2d" to get the daily OHLCV for every other day. You could set "interval" to "monthly" to get the first daily OHLCV for each month, or set it to "yearly" to get the daily OHLCV value against the same date every year.

        **Interval Options**
        There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "time_period" and "interval" parameters. For "time_period" these return aggregate OHLCV data from the beginning to end of each interval period. Apply these time intervals to "interval" to adjust how frequently "time_period" is sampled.

        The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
        **"daily"** - Calendar day intervals for each UTC day.
        **"weekly"** - Calendar week intervals for each calendar week.
        **"monthly"** - Calendar month intervals for each calendar month.
        **"yearly"** - Calendar year intervals for each calendar year.

        The second format is relative time:
        **"d"**: Time periods that repeat every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".

        **Note:** "time_period" currently only supports the "daily" option. "interval" supports all interval options.

        - ~~Hobbyist~~
        - Standard (1 month)

        **Cache / Update frequency:** Every 24 hours for 1 day OHLCV ranges. Additional OHLCV ranges will be available in the near-term.

      summary: Get market quotes (historical)
      description: |-
        Returns an interval of historic market quotes for any cryptocurrency based on time and interval parameters.

        **Technical Details**
        A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
        If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
        If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
        At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
        If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.

        **Interval Options**
        There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".

        The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
        **"hourly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
        **"daily"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
        **"weekly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
        **"monthly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
        **"yearly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.

        The second are relative time intervals.
        **"m"**: Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
        **"h"**: Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "6h", "12h".
        **"d"**: Get the first quote available every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".

  /v1/exchange/quotes/historical:
    get:
      summary: Get market quotes (historical)
      description: |-
        Returns an interval of historic quotes for any exchange based on time and interval parameters.

        Historical exchange quotes currently include:
        volume_24: Combined 24 hour volume for all market pairs at each historical interval.
        num_market_pairs: Number of market pairs available at each historical interval.
        Quotes are returned in USD. Additional currency conversion options and additional fields will be available in the future.

        **Technical Details**
        A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
        If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
        If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
        At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
        If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.

        **Interval Options**
        There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".

        The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
        **"hourly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
        **"daily"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
        **"weekly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
        **"monthly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
        **"yearly"** - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.

        The second are relative time intervals.
        **"m"**: Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
        **"h"**: Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "6h", "12h".
        **"d"**: Get the first quote available every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".
